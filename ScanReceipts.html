   <ul style="font-family:Benton Sans;">
    <li>Scan your receipts</li>
         <li>Taped receipts must be spaced and in the same direction</li>
     <li>Send the scan to <a href = "receipt@chromefile.com">receipt@chromefile.com</a></li>
         <li>Title the subject line with the Travelerâ€™s IU email address</li>
              <li>Large receipts may need to be cut to fit a page and taped close together so that they are read as a single receipt.</li>
